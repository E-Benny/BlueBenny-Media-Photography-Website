## BlueBenny Media Photography Website
This repository contains an HTML file that displays the website template of a modern photography website using exemplary fonts, images and a GSAP scroll function. This project was designed and developed uisng HTML, SCSS, Vanilla JavaScript, GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, ScrollTrigger and RWD.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file. In additon, you will need to use the CDNs for locomotive scroll, GSAP and ScrollTrigger.

## Project Status
